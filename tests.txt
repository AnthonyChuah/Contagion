Windows compilation (lazy to do separate compilation without UNIX make):


Individual compilation tests done for:

icard.cpp
pcard.cpp
hero.cpp
city.cpp
world.cpp

All specialization implementation files

Note: checks only COMPILATION errors, not logic errors or run-time errors.


Test for run-time errors:

g++ -g -std=c++11 icard.cpp pcard.cpp world.cpp city.cpp hero.cpp contplanner.cpp dispatcher.cpp medic.cpp opexpert.cpp qspecialist.cpp researcher.cpp scientist.cpp test.cpp -o test

test.exe


Todo:
